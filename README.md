# UncommonCurrencyRPG
Homebrew RPG using coins. Simple, few materials. Great for travel.

Uncommon Currency


    The group has been assembled; their eyes glint with the spark of adventure. They gathered rations and supplies for the events to come. Each with their own motives, they set forth on a journey. Nothing could prepare them for the trials ahead, for yay they had all left their dice bags at home. Yet, one did stand, refusing to fail. Upon the table he slammed his coinage; "We still have enough Two sided dice to go about!" Thus was created a new system of play. A game that is quick to start, simple to play, and requires few materials. That game is Uncommon Currency.

GAME MASTER

    The Game Master (or GM) is the narrator who sets the scene of the adventure. The GM has the responsibility of crafting the world and its inhabitants. They must also act as moderator, keeping track of rules or making them up when necessary. Those with a quick wit and a penchant for the dramatic will find it very rewarding; any setting is possible. Send your group through a dark playground of a vast, steam-powered distopia. Have the inhabitants whisper as they pass. Dangle tempting bits of information to steer the party toward traps or salvation. Rewards are to be found in looks of surprise, joy, and amusement from the players. The greatest reward though, is a story that can only be crafted with the uncertainty of a coin flip.

CHARACTER CREATION

    The first thing any adventure needs (other than snacks) are some main characters. Each player must decide who they want to be. Perhaps you're a dwarven guard who moonlights as a thief, or you prefer an elven mechanic with a psychotic streak (someone has to build the dungeon traps). Don't be limited by common tropes; it's good to be unique. I hear pastel colored ponies are fairly interesting.

*Each character starts with 3 points to spend on "attributes," and 2 "personas(level 2)." 
*Attributes are natural affinities and cannot change (like genetics). There are 3 possible attributes: Body, Reflexes, and Mind. Body is how strong and resilient you are. Reflexes are how quick, deft, and agile you are. Mind is how observant, witty, or knowledgeable you are. 
*Personas are shorthand for understanding a character's skill set (such as swashbuckler, acrobat, con artist, MacGyver). If you're a Viking you fight, raid, and sail. Personas may be added to later (4 personas total, max of 4 levels each). 
*Players may add 1 disability (total) to add 1 persona(level 1) at creation. Disabilities are physical or psychological limitations (such as addiction, feebleness, or phobia). It might decrease the number of coins for certain actions, or could be a case of "if 'x' happens, resist 'y' or else 'z'," or whatever else may be deemed fair by player and GM. 
*Personas/disabilities are based on the imagination of the player and the approval of the GM. 

    Now lets create a character. He will be Gryfyd of Høderselde. For his attributes he'll have 1 point in Reflex and 2 in Mind. For his two first personas he is a noble(lvl2) and a scholar(lvl2). To give him combat abilities, we'll take a disability. He now has the persona of Beast-Form(lvl1), but at the price of Blood-Rage; any time he is provoked he must make a check on mind (checks described later). If he fails to resist the Blood-Rage, he must attack the provoker or nearest person to first blood. In Beast-Form he physically changes. He becomes stronger, grows long claws and heightened senses (long ears, sharp teeth, fur, and slit pupils). His Beast-Form is often a source of alienation or offense. 

    Along with a character's capabilities, the player should describe their character. Other than appearance, there are 3 questions to consider:
    What is the character's demeanor? They could be friendly, reclusive, or somewhere in between. 
    What are the character's aspirations? People go on adventurers to seek wealth, power, freedom, justice, fun or something else. 
    What is their gut reaction to any situation? They may charge in, or hide in waiting for an opportune moment. Maybe they walk up and start a conversation. 
    If you can sum these up in one sentence, that's good enough. For example, "Gryfyd is a reserved, troubled soul looking to heal the family curse - a blood-rage he must resist at the slightest provocation." Role-playing the character with these answers in mind can lead to interesting character development and story. Starting a conversation with a guard who's looking for the party might be foolish, but motives and reactions often are. That's what makes them interesting.

EQUIPMENT

    We often carry things in our pockets that help with daily tasks. This is especially true for adventurers whose lives depend on their tools. We can't carry everything, so we carry compromises. Instead of a bag, you might bring a blanket; a blanket can be a cloak or pack while traveling and can be slept under at night. Keep compromises in mind when equipping characters, because even minor loads would tire an adventurer over long periods. Such details can put players in the mindset of traversing a vast region, whether it be of wood, grass, or concrete. 

*Each player starts with 3 basic items of the player's choice that are fitting to their personas. A mechanic might have a simple tool kit and a guardsman might have a type of pole-arm.
*A character should have the appropriate equipment for any task they may attempt; i.e. picking locks requires some form of lock picks.
*A character can only carry as much stuff as can be legibly written on a sticky-note sized area. Items carried must be reasonable. You might carry a crossbow on a sling, but a hydraulic-battering ram is a bit much for everyday life. 
*Should you acquire transportation, you may carry or tow extra equipment. For the purpose of cargo space, a bunch of little things (1 sticky-note) or one very large thing (such as a freshly hunted elk) is considered to be 1 load.
*A pack animal/vehicle (like a pony or ATV) may carry/tow 1 load. Larger vehicles/animals might carry multiple loads.

    Our character Gryfyd of Høderselde gets 3 items fitting his personas. The first is a Patent of Nobility; proof of family rank. The second is a Family Locket filled with cryptic hints about his curse. The player and GM decide that the locket counts as his weapon, allowing him to change into Beast form at will (but cannot cause or stop Blood-Rage). Lastly he has a Notebook of compiled research on history and occult curses. 

    The items a person carries tell a story. Items show what a person values and prioritizes. The player might think that a flaming great sword is awesome, but if the character uses pistols he'd have no use for it. You may sell it immediately, but if you'd be required to walk days, it might not be worth the weight. If you find a sentimental token, you'll keep it in spite of no logical use. When acquiring equipment, think of how your character sees it.
*

CHALLENGE CHECKS

    We come to the meat of the system. Almost all role-playing games use dice in order to determine how successful a player is at performing difficult tasks. Many use 6 sided dice (referred to as a d6) but a few games only use the 1-3 sides as a fail and the 4-6 sides as a success. This essentially makes a d6 work as a 2 sided die (d2) with a 0 side and a 1 side. In this game, we've reached a natural connection between a d2 and a coin, where tails is 0 and heads is 1. The more coins flipped, the more of a bell-curve is created; the chances that half of the coins are heads/tails is very high and the chances of all heads or all tails tends toward slim but not impossible. There are ways of increasing your chances which will be discussed later. 

*Challenge "Checks" are used to overcome obstacles (physical or no). The player will be given a numeric level of difficulty. They then flip an appropriate number of coins (described momentarily) and try to have equal or more Heads (Successes) than that number. 
*The GM decides the difficulty of a check, which can range from 1(simple) to 8(beyond godly).
*Players start with 3 coins to flip. Add 1 coin per point of an applicable attribute and 1 coin for each level of 1 applicable persona. Subtract 1 for any disability that would hinder said action. Add any bennies and dis/advantages (more on that later).
*If all coins flipped are the same side up (which becomes more rare the more coins) certain things happen. All tails critical fails; incredibly bad things happen as decided by the GM. All heads critical succeeds; Add 1 extra success (and the GM might make something really good happen). 
                            
    Gryfyd was walking through the city gate when shoved by a guardsman. Gryfyd must remain calm or be forced to Blood-Rage. The GM sets the difficulty at a Level 2 Check adding mind only. The player starts with 3 coins and adds 2 coins for his mind attribute.
     *Check lvl2: 5 Coins - gets 2 heads. 
     Gryfyd barely resisted his Blood-Rage with his two successes matching the check level 2. He tried to intimidate the guard. "I am a Noble of Høderselde; you will let me pass!" The GM sets the Check at level 3. The Player can add his Mind attribute and Noble persona. 
     *Check lvl3: 7 coins - gets 7(crit), add 1 = 8 successes. 
     The guard stood in shock till his captain kicked him for insubordination. "Forgive me my lord; he will be dealt with." After dining with nobles and discussing local history, Gryfyd explored the city. He took a shortcut down an alley and was assaulted by a desperate youth. He tried to resist Blood-Rage. 
     *Check lvl2: 5 coins - gets 0(crit fail), really bad. 
     Gryfyd regained control but realized that he'd killed the boy. His unnatural ears heard people in the alley. If discovered with blood stained claws, he would be hunted as a monster. (dun dun dun) 
*

DIS/ADVANTAGE

    People generally try to find the easiest way to complete tasks and the same goes for your character. For example, you can break open a door by sheer force, but if your character knows structural engineering he'll see the weakest point. You might also create a disadvantage for enemies by throwing down caltrops during a chase. Describe your actions with detail and clever planning; the GM may reward you with an advantage.

*Dis/advantages influence the outcome of checks. The GM can decide that a circumstance could be considered dis/advantageous. 
*A situational advantage, such as studying a mechanism over time before disarming it or having specialized tools, grants 1 extra coin.
*A situational disadvantage, such as being hurried or having a sharpened bone instead of a knife removes 1 coin.

    Gryfyd was in danger of being found with bloody claws. To up the drama, the GM ruled that there's no time to change into human form. Gryfyd must hide, stand, or evade. The normally unscalable walls might accommodate his claws. The GM points out that his claws are slick with blood. He has a disadvantage. Difficulty is 2. 
    *Check lvl2: 4 coins(now 3) - 2 heads. 
    He climbed the wall. The voices below raised the alarm as he jumped into the next alley in front of a guard on his break. To avoid a fight, he decided to scare him off. Gryfyd bared his claws and licked the blood off one before he growled and slowly advanced. He adds Beast-Form and Mind and gets an advantage for the bloody claws. 
    *Check lvl3: 5 coins(now 6) - 4 heads
    Gryfyd was then very much alone in the alley where he found a rain barrel. He cleaned the blood and reverted to human form before escaping into the crowded streets. 
*

BENNIES

*Bennies are tokens that may be spent to add extra successes on any check; they encourage role-playing and story building. 
*Players start each game session with 3 bennies apiece which can be shared amongst the party.
*Each bennie is worth 1 success. Any number of bennies can be spent after any check.
*Each player may earn more by role-playing their character very well (like feeding the moat monster and naming it Steve). Bennies don't carry over to the next game session. 
*
                                                                  
PASSIVE CONTESTS

*Contests are special checks used to overcome opponents (in or out of combat). 
*For passive contests, opponents start with 3 coins as usual. Add and subtract as you would with a normal check.
*Each opponent makes a check; the one with the most successes wins. If an opponent is acting against someone who is passive (like actively hiding from a passive guard) the tie goes to the defender. 
*

ACTIVE CONFLICTS

*Combat or other such ongoing conflicts (like a chase or trial by jury) continue for several rounds and each person gets an additional 2 coins and in combat can use their highest attribute. 
*In ongoing conflicts, each win removes the difference between the two rolls of coins from the loser. If an opponent has no coins left they are defeated. 
*For groups acting together, there are 2 ways to organize turns. The simple method is to add all successes for each group as a lump sum; the losing side gets to choose how to distribute damage. The more nuanced method is to have each character make a reflex check; highest goes first, ties roll against each other. 
*Each character may make 1 action (attacking, making a distracting, kicking over a table). Only acting with the group counts toward the lump sum in the first method; i.e. throwing down caltrops doesn't count as attacking the opponent. 
*

CURRENCY

*Instead of keeping track of funds, a purchase is a single check to locate a suitable item at a price within budget.
*Each character may attempt to buy 1 item per visit to a market or shop. Alternatively, one character can assist another. By forgoing their own purchase, they can give an advantage to someone else. 
*Start with 3 coins; add and subtract coins as usual for checks. Mind is the only attribute that applies. 
*Items of value can be sold to increase the chances of purchase by appropriate levels of success. Such items being sold are only lost if the check is successful.
*

CHARACTER PROGRESSION

*A character may earn Experience Points (or XP) to spend on personas. The group may earn points after landmark achievements (they slew a dragon or conned the mafia and barely escaped) or at the end of a play session. Players can save XP to spend later if they wish. 
*1 XP can increase a persona's level by 1 to a max of 4 levels. You can use more coins in Checks the higher the level of persona being used. 
*2 XP can create a level 1 persona, max 4 personas total. Each persona you have is another skill set at your disposal. Any new persona should make narrative sense; a viking probably won't  learn astrophysics on campaign. Discuss with the GM how you gain this new ability. 
*3 XP can remove a disability. You are no longer hindered; however, disabilities probably don't just "get better." Regrowing a leg is unlikely, but fitting a cybernetic leg is not. Discuss how you overcome the disability with the GM and role-play the scenario.
